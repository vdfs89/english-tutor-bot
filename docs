## 🚀 1. Clone the Repository / Clonar o Repositório

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vdfs89/english-tutor-bot.git
cd english-tutor-bot
```

## 🐍 2. Backend Setup (Python & Streamlit)

The backend powers the AI logic using Streamlit and LangChain.

### 2.1. Create a Virtual Environment

It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2.2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root directory (if not already there) and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 2.3. Configure Environment Variables

You need a Groq API key to run the AI models.

1.  Get your API Key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com).
2.  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
3.  Add your key to the file:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_api_key_here
```

### 2.4. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run backend/interface_streamlit.py
```

The app should open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 📱 3. Mobile App Setup (Flutter)

The mobile application is built with Flutter.

### 3.1. Install Flutter Dependencies

Make sure you are in the root directory of the project.

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3.2. Run the App

Connect a device or start an emulator/simulator.

```bash
flutter run
```

## 🧪 4. Running Tests

### Python (Linting)
To check for style issues in the backend code:

```bash
flake8 backend
```

### Flutter (Widget Tests)
To run the widget tests:

```bash
flutter test
```
